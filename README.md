Introduce_Me

Hey there! I'm Ziay

I make sounds—and tools to shape them.  
I’m diving deep into audio plugin development,  
mixing a bit of DSP, a dash of acoustics, and a whole lot of curiosity. Also, I production EDM to.

 Currently: building JUCE-based plugins (yes, with that analog warmth)  
 Tools I like: Reaper, Max, VCV Rack  
 When I'm not coding, I'm probably tweaking synths or exporting weird textures.
